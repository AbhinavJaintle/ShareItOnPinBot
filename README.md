One of my friends asked me a few days back if there was a direct way to save a tweet to @Pinterest. There was none. So, I made a bot which can do that for you. 


## Description

ShareItOnPin is a twitter bot, made by using Tweepy library assisted by Twitter Developer Tools.

## How to use it?

Go to twitter.com and click on the tweetr you want to save on your board.

In the reply to the tweet, mention @ShareItOnPin

The bot replies with a thread of two tweets:
* First is the screenshot of the original tweet
